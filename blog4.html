			<p>Health education builds student's  knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes about health.
				 <br /><br />Health education teaches about physical, mental, emotional and social health. It motivates 
				 students to improve and maintain their health, prevent disease, and reduce risky behaviours.
				 <br /><br />
				 Health education curricula and instruction help students to learn skills so
				 that they will use to make healthy choices throughout their lifetime.
				 <br /><br />
				 Health education is vital for students as it builds their knowledge and attitudes about health
				 <br /><br />
				 Health education does not only concentrate on being healthy. It also focuses on emotional,
				 mental and social health too. Educating students on the importance of health builds their motivation. 
				 <br /><br />
				 As a result, they strive to maintain good health, prevent diseases and avoid risky behaviour. Instilling the importance of good 
				 health in schools, helps students to make healthy life choices when they grow older and continue doing so throughout their lives.
				 <br /><br />
				 It helps them understand the dangers of using illicit drugs, smoking and drinking alcohol. It helps prevent
				 injuries, diseases, such as, obesity and diabetes, and sexually transmitted diseas.

			<p>Exercise boosts energy
				<br /><br />
				Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
				<br /><br />
				Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular
				system work more efficiently.
				<br /><br />
				And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more
				energy to tackle daily chores.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">Sleep seven to eight hours a night..</h2>
			<p>
				Scientific research makes clear that sleep is essential at any age.
				<br /><br />
				Sleep powers the mind, restores the body, and fortifies virtually every system in the
				body. But how much sleep do we really need in order to get these benefits?
				<br /><br />
				National Sleep Foundation guidelines1 advise that healthy adults need between 7 and 9 hours of
				sleep per night. Babies, young children, and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and
				development. People over 65 should also get 7 to 8 hours per night
