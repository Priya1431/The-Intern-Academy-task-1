			<h1 class="blog-subtitle">Why health eduction is important</h1>
			<p>Health education builds student's  knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes about health.
				
				<br /><br />
				Health education teaches about physical, mental, emotional and social health. It motivates 
				students to improve and maintain their health, prevent disease, and reduce risky behaviours.
				<br /><br />
				Health education curricula and instruction help students to learn skills so
				that they will use to make healthy choices throughout their lifetime.
				<br /><br />
				Health education is vital for students as it builds their knowledge and attitudes about health
				<br /><br />
				Health education does not only concentrate on being healthy. It also focuses on emotional,
				mental and social health too. Educating students on the importance of health builds their motivation. 
				<br /><br />
				As a result, they strive to maintain good health, prevent diseases and avoid risky behaviour. Instilling the importance of good 
				health in schools, helps students to make healthy life choices when they grow older and continue doing so throughout their lives.
				<br /><br />
				It helps them understand the dangers of using illicit drugs, smoking and drinking alcohol. It helps prevent
				injuries, diseases, such as, obesity and diabetes, and sexually transmitted diseases.
				
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">why healthy food is important</h2>
			<p>
				Our eating habits directly determine our health.
				<br /><br />
				In our busy schedules and fast lives, we often end up eating as per convenience
				, rather than what is healthy. 
				<br /><br />
				If healthy eating means being flexible with what you eat, youâ€™ll need to learn to adapt to
				the circumstances, which may happen more often than not.
				<br /><br />
				Many a times, we eat to please our taste buds, but remain quite
				unaware about the health hazards that this type of eating habit might pose.
				<br /><br />
				In a bid to lose weight, we also end up cutting out a few essential ingredients from our
				diet. This, instead of making us healthier, does the exact opposite.
				<br /><br />Every element is needed for your body, whether it is vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates,
				fibers or even fat (although choose the healthy ones). Each of these nutrients has their own
				individual roles to play in the physical and mental development.
