			 The United Nations Security Council adopts Resolution 1267, creating the so-called al-Qaeda
			 and Taliban Sanctions Committee, which links the two groups as terrorist entities and imposes 
			 sanctions on their funding, travel, and arms shipments.

			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">1.Who are the Taliban? </h2>
			<p>The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, but the group 
				has seized control of the country once again following a rapid offensive.
				 <br /><br />The capital, Kabul, was the last major city to fall to the offensive that began months ago but accelerated 
				 the hardline Islamists gained control of territories.The group entered direct talks with the US back in 2018, and in February 2020 the two sides struck
				 a peace deal that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces

				 <br /><br />Other promises included not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate
				 in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.
				 But in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security
				 forces and civilians, advancing rapidly across the country

			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">2.Rise to power </h2>
			<p>The Taliban, or "students" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan 
				following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
				 <br /><br />It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - 
				 mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam.

			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Taliban sweep into Afghan capital after government collapses</h2>

			<p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban swept into Afghanistan’s capital Sunday after the government collapsed
				and the embattled president joined an exodus of his fellow citizens and foreigners, 
				signaling the end of a costly two-decade U.S. campaign to remake the country.
				
				<br /><br />Heavily armed Taliban fighters fanned out across the capital, and several entered Kabul’s abandoned
				presidential palace. Suhail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesman and negotiator, told The Associated 
				Press that the militants would hold talks in the coming days aimed at forming an “open, inclusive Islamic government.”
				 <br /><br />Earlier, a Taliban official said the group would announce from the palace the restoration
				 the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the formal name of the country under Taliban rule before
				 the militants were ousted by U.S.-led forces in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, which were orchestrated
				 by al-Qaida while it was being sheltered by the Taliban. But that plan appeared to be on hold.

			<p>President Ashraf Ghani fled the country on Sunday as the Islamist terrorists entered the city, saying he
				wanted to avoid bloodshed, while hundreds of Afghans desperate to leave flooded Kabul airport.
